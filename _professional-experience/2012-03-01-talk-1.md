<ul>
    <li>Enhanced the company's flagship product, MoSMB - an SMB protocol based file server - by providing support that allows its users to store data on cloud.</li>
    <li>The file server used to store all its data locally which required on-premise data storage infrastructure.</li>
    <li>MoSMB was made capable of using Amazon Web Services' Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) and Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Storage for its data storage requirements.</li>
    <li>This project also allowed data stored on cloud platforms to be accessed using standard POSIX semantics which are widely known and used by legacy softwares.</li>
    <li>The company could now target the customers who used cloud storage or were migrating to cloud.</li>
    <li>An offer to woerk for the company full-time was also extended to me at the end of the internship.</li>
