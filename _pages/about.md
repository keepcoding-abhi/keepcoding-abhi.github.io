I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University and expecting to graduate in May 2024. I have demonstrated experience in developing solutions to diverse real world problems with the power of computer science. My interests lie in full-stack software development, cloud computing and machine learning.

During my tenure as a Software Engineer at eQ Technologic (India) Pvt. Ltd. I developed connectors that allowed the services of eQube Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) platform to be leveraged on Neo4j GraphDB, Deltek Costpoint and Polarion Application Lifecycle Management Software based on the requirements of enterprises from different parts of the world.

In my undergraduate studies, I did an internship at Ryussi Technologies Pvt. Ltd. The company offers a file server called MoSMB which supported on-premises data storage. I developed a solution that provided the clients of MoSMB the option of storing the data on different cloud-based object storage platforms like Amazon Web Services' Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) and Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Storage (GCP Cloud Storage), and also on MinIO native object storage.

Currently, I am working as a summer intern in Software Development at DISH Networks in Denver, CO. I am also looking for Software Engineering internship opportunities in Fall 2023 and full-time roles starting May 2024. Please reach out to me on assonaw1@asu.edu if you have any relevant positions in your organization. Thank you so much for visiting my website!
