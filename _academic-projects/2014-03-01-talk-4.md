<ul>
    <li>Cloud platforms offer several advantages over on-premise data storage. However, many people are still unfamiliar with the semantics of accessing cloud storage and several softwares rely on the old POSIX semantics for data access. This project provided access to cloud storage using POSIX semantics.</li>
    <li>Plugins were developed to facilitate data transfer between a Server Message Block (SMB) protocol based file server and cloud storage platforms like AWS and GCP.</li>
    <li>Although the data saved on file server was stored on cloud, the users were able to access it like any other file or folder stored on their device.</li>
