<ul>
    <li>The shape of a galaxy provides insights about its evolution and is an important aspect in astronomical research.</li>
    <li>Novel deep learning classifiers were proposed and trained to categorize galaxies into 10 classes using the galaxy images captured by space exploration missions.</li>
    <li>Transfer learning was used as opposed to the earlier works that trained networks from scratch.</li>
    <li>VGG-16, ResNet-50, XceptionNet, InceptionNet, and DenseNet-121 architectures were used to create 5 separate feature extraction models.</li>
    <li>The VGG-16 based model turned out to be the best one outperforming a state of the art <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/511/4/5120/6530659">model</a> in 8 of the 10 classes giving only 2% lower overall accuracy.</li>
    <li>The resource consumption in training the model was brought down by 60% and the number of models trained before finding the one that gives the best performance were reduced from several 100s to 10.</li>
