<ul>
    <li>Developed a portal to help emergency responders in planning rescue operations during the time of crisis.</li>
    <li>Crowd-sourced data collected from a disaster reporting mobile application was visualized in the form of line chart, choropleth map, dot plot, scatter plot, parallel co-ordinate plot, box plot and heatmap.</li>
    <li>The plots were interlinked to provide the users a cohesive understanding of the situation on ground, changes in the conditions over time and assess the reliability of the data reported.</li>
    <li>The failure of a parallel co-ordinate plot in visualizing large number of records was overcome by innovating a visualization technique which blended box-plot along with a parallel co-ordinate chart. This was done by grouping the records based on a meaningful criteria, in this case region where reports were made, and using a box-plot for each axis on parallel co-ordinate plot to represent the distribution of values within each group.</li>
