<ul>
    <li>Proposed and implemented the use of a policy-based proxy server to tackle SQL injection (SQLi) and Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks on web applications.</li>
    <li>Developed two versions of a web application for banking purposes. One version made use of a proxy server while the other version didn't.</li>
    <li>The proxy server receives and analyzes each request received from the client. It consists of a set of policies that determine whether a request is likely to cause an SQLi or XSS attack.</li>
    <li>If a request is likely to cause an attack, it is either sanitized or terminated before sending it to the main server.</li>
    <li>In the absence of a proxy server, the requests are directly sent to the actual server.</li>
    <li>The two versions of the application were used to demonstrate teh effectiveness of the proxy server in tackling different types of attacks.</li>
